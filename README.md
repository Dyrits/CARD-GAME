# Use MVC, SOLID Principles, and Design Patterns in Java

How can you measure the quality of one bit of code versus another?

Is there a way to recognize good code from mediocre (or worse)? Fortunately, there is! Software engineers have established guidelines for writing quality code. They are described in the SOLID design principles and model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern.

In this course, you will learn to write Java code that conforms to these guidelines. You will also see what each of the SOLID principles are, and then incorporate them into an ever-improving application. Finally, you will see and use the benefit of splitting responsibilities as described by the MVC pattern. You'll learn to integrate some other patterns, as well.

After completing this course, you will understand the measuring stick of quality code, after building an application following the guidelines.
